    <p> <a href="#block">BLOCKS</a></p>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <br><i>For other uses, see Block chain (disambiguation).</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.<sup>[5]</sup></p>
<br>
<p>A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.<sup>[6]</sup> The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need for a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications<sup>[3][2]</sup> and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.<sup>[7]</sup></p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups".<sup>[10]</sup> Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup> They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sup>[4][12]</sup> Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.<sup>[13]</sup> </p>
<br>
<p>The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.<sup>[4]</sup> The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.<sup>[3]</sup> </p>

<p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][20]</sup> This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[21]</sup> A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[22]</sup> Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[23]</sup> A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup> </p>
<p>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup>[24]</sup> </p>
<ul>
    <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
    <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation<sup>[25]</sup> and verification)</li>
    <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
    <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
    <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 id="block">Blocks</h2>
<p>Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.<sup>[3]</sup> Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.<sup>[3]</sup> This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the genesis block (Block 0).<sup>[26][27]</sup> To assure the integrity of a block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.<sup>[28]</sup> </p>
